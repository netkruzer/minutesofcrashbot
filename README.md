# minutesofcrashbot

Hello

IT's 10 years, very approximately, since crashspace was formed.

Minutes of crashbot is a group project by members of crashspace to commemorate our 10 year anniversary. 

The goal of the project is to incorperate the 10 years of meeting minutes into a bot that parses them and plays cat videos and gives random quips from crashspace meetings past, the crashcam flickr and ect. 

First thing we need to figure out is what it is. Come up with some concepts and add files to this github, and we'll pick the best functions and concepts and try to implement them.

Format files like this:

ConceptName1.txt
	Name and description of concept
	Functions
	Hardware description
	software description
